  - Styling: `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`
  - State Management: `axios`, `js-cookie`
  - Routing: `react-router-dom`
  - Additional Development Tools: Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer

### Backend:

- **Node.js** with the following packages:
  - Express.js for server setup
  - Mongoose for MongoDB integration
  - Authentication: `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`
  - Security: `cors`, `cookie-parser`, `crypto-js`
  - Configuration Management: `dotenv`
  - Development Utility: `nodemon`

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js installed
- MongoDB running locally or remotely

### Steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/litikesh/RBAC.git
    cd RBAC
    ```

2.  **Frontend Setup**:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

3.  **Backend Setup**:

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Environment Variables**:

    - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following:
      ```env
      PORT=5000
      JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret_key>
      JWT_EXPIRATION=<jwt_token_expiration_time> # e.g., 1h, 7d
      CONNECTION_STRING=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
      ```

---

## Usage

1. Start the frontend and backend servers.
2. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Log in with the appropriate role:
   - Super Admin: Full control over users and permissions.
   - Admin: Limited control based on granted permissions.
   - User: Can only log in and use general application features.

---

## Logs Feature

Admins can view all actions performed on user accounts:

- Assigning roles
- Granting or revoking permissions
- Blocking or unblocking users
- Deleting users

Logs ensure transparency and traceability of all administrative actions.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add multi-factor authentication for improved security.
- Implement more granular permissions for Admins.
- Provide a dashboard for analytics on user activities.
- Enable notifications for critical actions (e.g., role changes).
